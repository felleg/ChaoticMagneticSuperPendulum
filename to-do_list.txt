EASY:------------
Functionality "add magnet" button
Draw trace UNDER magnets and pendulum
High default friction value
Make trace be drawn only after start button has been pressed (right now, moving pendulum by hand withotu pressing start still creates a trace)
Make the frame rate slider effective
Make magnet movement and polarity double-click compatible with mobile
Make default value of magnet strength = 15*1e5


NEEDS MORE WORK:--------
Add a "Pause" button
Create new simulateStep() that uses the Runga-Kutta method
Add a button that adds a second pendulum (pendulums don't interact with each other), see effect of chaos theory
Allow to remove magnets
Find conditions to declare pendulum has stopped over a magnet (low velocity and over magnet)

EASY:--------
Make threshold value for pendulum capture by a magnet equal to 1500
Make string of pendulum drawn over pendulum circle, to mimick top view of pendulum

NEEDS MORE WORK:--------
Add Slider that determines number of magnets in the field
Add a button that adds a second pendulum (pendulums don't interact with each other), see effect of chaos theory
Allow to remove magnets
Make magnet movement and polarity double-click compatible with mobile
